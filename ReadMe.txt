I made it all myself except fonts and library. Rest is made using another tools such as pixlr to make textures.

Also the game is not original, it's just inspiration from a game "Minesweeper" for educational purpose.

The game has been developed since 01.29.2022 and major code has been finished at 02.02.2022.

The code is open source, you can grab it and play around, edit. However i do not wish it to be copyied, edited and sold.
