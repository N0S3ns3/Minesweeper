I made it all myself except fonts and library. Rest is made using another tools such as pixlr to make textures.

Also the game is not original, it's just inspiration from a game "Minesweeper" for educational purpose.

The game has been developed since 01.29.2022 and major code has been finished at 02.02.2022.

The code is open source, you can grab it and play around, edit. However i do not wish it to be copyied, edited and sold.

[===IDE===]
The project was using visual studio community 2022. So i was using visual studio solution, it might just not work with other IDE
when using visual solution with another.

However you can find [Source.cpp] which is source of code at [Minesweeper>Source.cpp]. Which can be opened with any IDE or typing program.
Though to run this you would need realease or debugg .[exe].

[===License===]
This project is using License [MIT]. Which you can find on text [LICENSE.txt]

[===Shortcut===]
I have made shortcut called "Minesweeper", you can copy and paste it on desktop or just access it there were it is.
